TO-DO: 

_ Implement the following
	_ Dice
	_ Cards
	_ Journal
	_ Map
	_ Settings

_ Rework print_center and print_line functions or ditch
  them. They don't play nice with the color format 
  specifiers
  	_ If this gets done, we can probably ditch the 
  	  get_terminal_width function, which not really
  	  adding a lot of value to the UX

_ Maybe add a clock? Timer? Hmm.
