# Sojourn Buddy - Terminal Toolkit for Playing Solo-Journaling TTRPGs

Sojourn Buddy is a simple toolkit that is geared toward fans of solo-journaling TTRPGs, allowing
for play on the go where a table or some components may not be available. 

### Development

Planned features include: 
- Dice Bag, a selection of common gaming dice and simple commands
- Deck of Cards, used in a variety of ways in solo RPGs (jokers optional)
- Journaling, the core of solo-journaling RPGs with simple formatting, outputs to a md file
- Map-Maker, a simple room-and-label creation system to build your map
- Character Sheet, a profile page to store and update character information
- Save State, so you can pick up where you left off later on or have multiple games going

More features may be added as I think of them or see a need.

### Q&A

1. Why C? Because I like C. It runs on everything.
2. Why terminal/cli-based? Because GUIs are clunky, slow things down, and I don't want to distract from the game the player is enjoying
3. What's the ideal use-case? Say you're out and about, maybe riding a train or waiting in a long line at the DMV. You are bored out of your mind, but have your Android phone with Termux loaded and a PDF copy of your solo-journaling game rules saved. With Sojourn Buddy, you have everything you need to play and track your game. But you can use it at home, too!
